# Project Design Thinking (Calm Focus)

## Calm Focus — A physical–digital play system that helps autistic children improve focus and coordination
I believe that the development of the Calm Focus project has significantly enhanced my understanding of autism and the challenges faced by individuals on the spectrum. Through this project, I learned how to translate conceptual ideas into practical digital solutions aimed at supporting children with autism. The project leverages advancements in technology to contribute meaningfully to the well-being of the younger generation by providing supportive and accessible tools.

Additionally, this experience has deepened my appreciation of the role that data and technology play in designing and developing effective digital solutions for children with developmental disorders. It also highlighted the importance of supporting technological innovation with sufficient statistical evidence and data-driven insights to ensure the reliability, effectiveness, and impact of such solutions.
